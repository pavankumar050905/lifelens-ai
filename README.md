👋 Hi, this is LifeLens AI — a fully multimodal assistant powered by Google Gemini.

Let me show you how it helps in real-life situations.

---

** Damage Photo Analysis**
I’ll start by uploading a photo of a broken device.
LifeLens automatically detects the damage, identifies the type of crack, and tells me whether it can be repaired.

It even gives step-by-step guidance and speaks out loud using Gemini audio mode.

---

 **2. Food Photo → Calories + Nutrition**
Now let’s analyze a food photo.
LifeLens identifies the food items automatically from the picture.

It estimates calories, nutrition values, and even gives personalized dietary suggestions.

---

 **3. BMI + Health Suggestions**
If I provide height and weight, LifeLens calculates BMI and determines my health category.

It then tailors recommendations based on both BMI and the food I uploaded.

---

 **4. Voice Input + Spoken Output**
I can ask LifeLens questions with my microphone, and the AI responds in natural audio using Gemini’s speech output.

This makes the interaction seamless and accessible.

---

 **Conclusion**
LifeLens AI brings together vision, audio, nutrition, health, and repair assistance — all in a single experience powered by Google Gemini.

Thank you!
